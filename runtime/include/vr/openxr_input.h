// OpenXR action-based controller input.
//
// Quest Touch controllers are not visible to SDL's joystick layer (the OS does
// not expose them as HID gamepads), so a standalone headset build would have no
// input at all. This module syncs an OpenXR action set on the pacing thread and
// feeds a virtual SDL joystick (SDL_AttachVirtualJoystick) that Aurora's
// existing controller code opens and assigns to a port exactly like a physical
// pad. What the game then sees on that port depends on OpenXRControllerMode:
//
// Wii Remote (default): the port is served through KPAD as a Wii Remote with a
// Nunchuk, like DolphinXR's OpenXR Wii Remote. Every XR frame the aim and grip
// poses are located at the measured current time, turned into both
// accelerometers and the IR pointer (the right aim ray against the virtual
// screen the renderer is showing), and published through openxr_wii_remote.h.
// Buttons are adapted from DolphinXR's "OpenXR Wii Remote" profile (see
// RemoteButtons).
// The game's rumble drives both controllers' haptics.
//
// Gamepad: the virtual joystick is read through PAD as a GameCube controller,
// and every binding the settings overlay offers applies:
//   right A / B            -> gamepad South / East (GameCube A / B)
//   left  X / Y            -> gamepad West / North (GameCube X / Y)
//   index triggers         -> left / right trigger axes
//   grip squeezes          -> left / right shoulder buttons
//   left / right thumbstick-> left / right stick axes, clicks -> stick buttons
//   left menu              -> Start
//
// None: the virtual joystick is unplugged, so the controllers hold no port and
// another controller (a desktop gamepad, a Bluetooth remote) plays in their
// place. The game sees them idle, the way it does while the settings panel has
// them; they still open the panel and toggle the first-person camera.
//
// Both are bound for the Oculus Touch profile; khr/simple_controller gets
// select/menu and the poses so an unknown runtime still offers something.
//
// In the first-person cockpit (openxr_driving.h) the grip poses are located in
// the seated frame every frame. With hand steering on, a squeezed grip near the
// steering wheel or handlebar takes hold of it; while held, the wheel replaces
// the left stick's X axis in both presentations and that grip no longer reaches
// the game (a shoulder on the gamepad; as a Wii Remote the grips are unbound,
// so a hand on the wheel cannot hold down a button).
//
// Throwing the held item ([vr] cockpit_item_throw, openxr_item_throw.h): in the
// cockpit, a quick swing forward or back of the hand showing the item pushes the
// left stick that way while the left trigger (Z, or the GameCube's L) is pressed
// and released, which the game reads as an aimed throw.
//
// Tracked hands ([vr] hand_tracking, with hand steering): two hand trackers
// (XR_EXT_hand_tracking) located every frame give the cockpit the hands' own
// joints, from the controllers' touch sensors while they are held and from the
// cameras once they are put down. On the Quest a hand that drives
// khr/simple_controller instead of the Touch profile has bare-hand buttons
// (openxr_hand_tracking.h): with the option off it presses nothing but the menu
// gesture, so the manifest's hand-tracking permission changes nothing for
// players who leave it off.
//
// A right-thumbstick click on its own toggles the first-person camera, as its
// F10 checkbox does (first_person_toggle_click).
//
// Left Y (both thumbsticks clicked together as a gamepad) opens the in-headset
// settings panel (openxr_settings_panel.h). While it is open, and until every
// button has been released after it closes, the game sees idle controllers: the
// panel button, the pointer and the triggers belong to the panel.
//
// Lifetime: Create after the session exists (attaches the action set, which
// OpenXR permits once per session), Sync once per xrWaitFrame, Idle while the
// session is not running, Destroy before the session is destroyed. All of them
// run on the XR pacing thread. The Wii Remote bridge is internally locked, so
// the game thread may read it concurrently, and the virtual gamepad is only
// published here: OpenXRApplyVirtualGamepad() performs the SDL writes on the
// game thread, and plugs the joystick in or out as the controller mode
// changes, keeping SDL's joystick lock off this thread during a session.
